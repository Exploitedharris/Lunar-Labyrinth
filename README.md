Lunar Labyrinth
Lunar Labyrinth is an engaging 2D maze exploration game built using C++ and the SFML library. Navigate through randomly generated mazes, collect keys to unlock the exit, and avoid traps to progress through levels. This open-source project demonstrates procedural generation and maze-based gameplay in C++. Your support through GitHub Sponsors helps us enhance the game with new features and keep it free for the community!
Features

Procedurally generated mazes using recursive backtracking.
Key collection to unlock exits and progress to new levels.
Traps that penalize the player and reset their position.
Score tracking based on key collection and level completion.
Audio feedback for movement, key collection, and trap triggers.
Lightweight and extensible codebase.

Gameplay

Objective: Find and collect 3 keys to unlock the exit, avoid traps, and advance to the next level.
Controls:
Arrow Keys: Move the player through the maze.


Scoring:
Collect a key: +50 points.
Hit a trap: -20 points.
Reach the exit: +100 points.


Mechanics:

cd LunarLabyrinth


Install SFML:

Download SFML from sfml-dev.org.
Follow the installation instructions for your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Link SFML libraries (graphics, window, system, audio) in your project.


Add Resources:

Place arial.ttf (e.g., from Google Fonts) in the project directory.
Place move.wav, key.wav, and trap.wav (e.g., from Freesound) in the project directory.


Build the Project:

Example using g++:g++ -c main.cpp -I/path/to/sfml/include
g++ main.o -o LunarLabyrinth -L/path/to/sfml/lib -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio




Run the Game:
./LunarLabyrinth
